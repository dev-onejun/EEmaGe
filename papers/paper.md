# (Working Title) EEmaGe: EEG-based Image Generation for Visual Reconstruction

**Hypothesis**

1) Supervision is not required to construct the human's visual system.
2) Excluding visual cues from extracting EEG features are ultimately required.

***Abstract***

Visual reconstruction from EEG has been paved with the advancement of AI. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of reconstructing images from EEG recordings in designed experiments. Nevertheless, even though breakthroughs in AI have begun with imitating the human system, these frameworks lack resemblance to the visual system of the human. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel framework called EEmaGe which utilizes self-supervised learning to reconstruct images from raw EEG data. Unlike the previous methods which rely on supervised learning and labeled data using visual cues, the framework employs *a self-supervised autoencoder and downstream task* to extract meaningful EEG features. *The experimental results showcase the state-of-the-art performance of the framework in metrics related to MSE.* As the RE2I approach, the research has the potential to contribute to advance our knowledge about the intricacies of the human brain and to develop more sophisticated AI systems that effectively mock human visual perception.

## I. Introduction

**WHY IS SUPERVISION NOT REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM?**
It is a fact that things always exist regardless of someone's perception. This influenced that the definitions of looking, seeing, and watching are different. Looking is to toward eyes somewhere, seeing is to perceive things what eyes direct, and watching is to spend time and pay attention to the things [4]. In other words, 'looking' belongs to the 'seeing' set and 'seeing' belongs to the 'watching' set. The visual system of humans performs looking, meaning that, supervision is not required to imitate the system. **IS VISUAL RECONSTRUCTION TASK SAME AS LOOKING(-VISUAL SYSTEM)?**

BCI, firstly proposed by Vidal [10], has seeked to the key of the human brain where the area has yet been conquered. Disabled people are expected to be benefited to live real lives with others, if BCI researches continuously evolve. Among the methodlogies of BCIs, EEG analysis has especially been drawn attention due to its advantages, non-invasive and cost-effectie sensors which are utilized during brain measurements. The analysis, which uses a signal recorded electrical activities of brains [5], is pervasively adopted in medical and research areas to diagnose brain diseases. Even though its effectiveness in those areas, EEG required manual analysis of experts like physicians and researchers [11].


AI has been adnvaced with imitating the system of human beings. For instance, Neural Network [1] mimicked the human nervous system as well as its advancement like CNN [2] and SWNet [3] (imitate/mimic/resemble).


Aligning with AI technologies, many researches founded that EEG is able to reproduce visual experiences with deep learning algorithms.


For instance, shedding a light on generating images from feature vectors with GANs, the networks were employed to generate images from EEG signals [6, 8, 9].


The adoption of SSL has enabled the extraction of features from EEG data without supervision []. However, despite this liberation from supervision, visual cues are still employed, thereby limiting the ability to fully imitate the
visual system.

Furthermore, eliminating visual cues is crucial in moving towards a more universal BCI, making this research applicable to everyday life situations.


In conclusion, the paper conducts and expects to the following bullet points;
* EEmaGe, a novel visual reconstruction framework, which applies SSL in order to preclude the supervision and visual cues is proposed.
* With this work, a step to generalized BCI which is needed to real-world application is anticipated.

Palazzo et al [6] firstly founded that visual experience can be generated from EEG signals. The research recorded the signals while presenting the ImageNet [7] dataset to subjects. Although the research firstly founded that visual experience can be generated from EEG signals, the proposed method were limited to the dataset category since it relied on supervised learning.

**A. EEmaGe**

**WHY DID YOU MAKE THE MODEL LIKE THIS?**
In order to achieve the goals of the research which is the exclusion of the supervision in the reconstruction task, self-supervised learning is adopted to implement a model training. Autoencoder is a representative self-supervised learning method hinged on neural net architectures.

EEmaGe is an autoencoder-based model architecture which gets an input (*e*, *i*) pair where *e* is an EEG and *i* is an image. The pair is shuffled from its own pair matched by original datasets. (***or make all possible pairs to maximize the number of the data*** ) Two autoencoders which their encoders share weights with each others comprise the architecture.

**B. Downstream Tasks**

In this research, a downstream task is defined as reconstructing images from EEG signals with an autoencoder. The autoencoder is made up of the EEG encoder and the image decoder from EEmaGe. Inferences of the autoencoder solely implement to make the images.

***WHICH METRICS IS SUITTED TO ASSESS THIS TASK?***
The output images are compared by *FID* with the original images.
